## Scope

The scope of the project in itâ€™s first release is defined by the following features:

- Simple navigation that clearly shows the user what page they are currently on.  
- A footer on all pages that allows users to sign up to the mailing list and connect to social media platforms.
- A detailed section on the home page (index.html) that shows the pricing for subscribing to the websites services.
- Login and register links on all pages that display a modal to allow users to register or login.
- Artist (artists.html) and genre (genre.html) page that allows users to browse artists by letter or genre.
- Link to external YouTube site for each artists music, making sure that the page opens in a new tab/window. 
- Contact page with form to allow users to send queries. The form is functional and will not submit unless all fields are filled out.
- An error page (404.html) that directs users back to the previous page they were on if visiting a page that does not exist.
- An Events page (events.html) that allows users to see the latest events and navigate to their respective pages.
- A News page (news.html) that shows all the latest news.
- Google map embedded to display the location of the sites business office.
- Clear and simple favicon icon to help users identify the site.

Features to be built in future releases:

- In house music player, which is currently disabled, will be developed so that artist links will trigger the player instead of navigating to a YouTube link.
- Currently the comments form on each article navigates to a placeholder - this will be developed to display comments under each article.
- Search bar on navigation will be developed to help users quickly explore the catalogue of music on website.
- Develop login and register modals to store users details and subscription information in a database. This will also lead to a users account page being developed based on whether users are artists or fans.
- Mailing list form will successfully store visitors emails within a database for future alerts.
